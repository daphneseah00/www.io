<ol>
 <li style="font-family: courier new; font-size: 25px;">TORPEDO</li>
<img src="https://wildwildwet.blob.core.windows.net/assets/images/default-source/rides/torpedo.jpg?sfvrsn=a608c1d4_0" width="450" height="300" alt="torpedo">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; font-family:Georgia;">
This attraction is <b>NOT</b> for the FAINT-HEARTED. So how does it work? You go into a tube and a countdown starts. Once the countdown ends, the platform you are standing on releases and you experience a FREE FALL with twists and turns. It can be intimidating at first but this ride is the epitome of thrill. I do not recommend children to go on this ride.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px; font-family:Georgia;">
This is a fun ride to go on with your friends and family. I think it is suitable for people of all ages so do try it out with your whole family!! I found this ride quite relaxing with some twist and turns along the way but nothing too extreme. It is the <mark>first raft slide</mark> in Southeast Asia so do check  out this super flume ride when you visit Wild Wild Wet.</p>

 <li style="font-family:courier new; font-size: 25px;">TSUNAMI</li>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px; font-family:Georgia;">
The tsunami attraction is one of the favourites at Wild Wild Wet. From my experience, this attraction is much more enjoyable when there are lesser people so pick a time when the crowds are not too large to enjoy it. It is a great place to chill and recharge when you get tired from the thrill of the other rides.</p>

 <li style="font-family:courier new; font-size: 25px;">SLIDE UP</li>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 18px; font-family:georgia;">
This ride is perfect for you if you are a thrill-seeker. This ride has a four-storey high ramp and it is powered by gravity and kinetic energy. It is not as scary as the Torpedo ride mostly because you can ride it with a partner. The initial drop is the most thrilling part of the ride especially if you are the one facing backwards. I highly recommend you try this ride out with a partner.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; font-family:georgia;">
This playground is pretty much <b>EVERY CHILD'S DREAM</b>. It is a really fun place for children to explore and have fun. A cool thing about this playground is that it has an area with a giant bucket that fills up with water, when the time is up the bucket flips and pours all the water out on you!! A lot of people camp underneath the bucket just to experience the splash.</p>

 <li style="font-family:courier new; font-size: 25px;">KRAKEN RACERS</li>
<img src="https://wildwildwet.blob.core.windows.net/assets/images/default-source/rides/kraken-racer/kraken-racer-1_2738b024-1d0b-4bf8-a354-34859c557c4d.jpg?sfvrsn=316d923_12" width="450" height="300" alt="kraken racer">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; font-family:georgia;">
Kraken Racers is one of the <b>NEWER</b> rides in Wild Wild Wet. It is Singapore's <I>first four-lane mat racer slide</I>. This is a fun ride to go on to have some friendly competition with your friends and family. Since this is a newer ride, I can't really give a recommendation on it as I myself have not tried it but do check it out for yourself when you visit the water park!!

<li style="font-family:courier new; font-size: 25px;">Royal Flush</li>
<img src="https://wildwildwet.blob.core.windows.net/assets/images/default-source/rides/royal-flushdc98faf452064e8dac5a12b43e827d7f.jpg?sfvrsn=9c9eb406_0" width="450" height="300" alt="royal flush">
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:18px; font-family:georgia;">
Royal Flush is one of the two <b><mark>NEWEST</mark></b> rides in Wild Wild Wet. It is the <I>first hybrid ride</I> combining the Behemoth BOWL40 and TornadoWAVE. The raft slides down the tunnel and up a near-vertical wall at crazy speeds. Once again, as I have not experienced this ride yet, it is hard for me to give my personal opinion but according to other reviews I have read, this ride seems to be fan-favourite.</p>
